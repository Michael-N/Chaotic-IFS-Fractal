# Chaotic IFS Fractal
This is a Fractal generator based upon the work done by Michael Barnsley
and is implemented in Numpy

## Dependancies (non default included in python distro)
+ matplotlib.pyplt
+ numpy
+ pylab
+ scipy.stats

## Predefined Transformations
+ ```barnsley```: barnsley fern as researched by michael barnsley
+ ```triangle```: A serinpenski triangle
+ ```goldenDragon```: the golden dragon spiral based off of the golden ratio
+ ```tree```: a Symetric Binary tree with no stems scale 0.7 rotation 9 deg
+ ```pentadentrite```: a slice of a branched pentagonal fractal which is a fractal itself
+ ```koch```: Koch curve (approximate)
+ ```branch```: golden dragon rotated by the angles of the triangle conecting the golden dragon's attractors
+ ```rose```: a conch shell like spiraling rose - a neat constant set found...
+ ```nsn```: A galaxy like spiral ascending

## Features
+ Terminal Interface for configuring a Chaotic Iterated Function System: ```python ChaoticIFSFractal.py```
+ A few statistical tests on the numbers generated
